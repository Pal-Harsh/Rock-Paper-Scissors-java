Rock Paper Scissors - Java Game
About the Game
Welcome to the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, built using Java! This simple yet fun game allows you to play against the computer in a 5-round battle. Test your luck and strategy as you try to outsmart the computer!
Game Rules

Rock (0) beats Scissors (2)
Scissors (2) beats Paper (1)

How the Game Works

The game will display a welcome message and explain the rules.
You will be prompted to enter a number (0, 1, or 2) representing Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
The computer will randomly select its choice.
The winner of each round is decided based on the rules above.
After 5 rounds, the game announces the final winner based on the score.

Code Explanation

The game uses Scanner for user input and Random to generate the computerâ€™s choice.
A for loop runs 5 rounds to determine the winner.
The choices (Stone, Paper, Scissors) are stored in an array for easy reference.
Input validation is added to ensure the user enters only valid numbers (0, 1, or 2).
Final score calculation determines the winner after all rounds.
The Scanner is closed at the end to prevent memory leaks.
